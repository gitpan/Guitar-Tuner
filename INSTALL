1) Make sure that /dev/audio is writable by the user
using the program.

2) Make sure Requisite Module Dependencies Are In Place:

	use MIME::Base64 ();
	use Time::HiRes qw( usleep );

for Guitar::Tuner

and:
	use Term::ReadKey;

for "guitar-tuner.pl"

3) Uses usleep() for timing to wait for /dev/audio to close
before playing next string. May need to be adjusted in
source for your hardware to prevent "Device or Resource Busy"
error.

4) Uses alsa mixer program (amixer) to adjust volume,
via system(), in "guitar-tuner.pl", included in distribution.
Can also use `aumix` on some systems, with appropriate
command line options.
